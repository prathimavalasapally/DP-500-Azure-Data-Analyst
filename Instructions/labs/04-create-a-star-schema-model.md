    ![](../images/dp500-create-a-star-schema-model-image3h.png)

1. Navigate to **Manage**, select **Publish all** and then click on **Publish** to ensure changes are published.

## Develop a data model

In this exercise, you will develop a DirectQuery model to support Power BI analysis and reporting of the data warehouse reseller sales subject.

### Download a dataset file

In this task, you will download a Power BI data source file from Synapse Studio.

1. In Microsoft Edge, navigate to **Synapse Studio**.

    ![](../images/dp500-create-a-star-schema-model-image4a.png)

2. At the left, select the **Develop** hub.

	![](../images/dp500-16.png)

3. In the **Develop** pane, expand **Power BI**, then expand the workspace, and then select **Power BI datasets**. If not present, Click **Publish all** to publish Workspace and refresh the browser.

	![](../images/dp500-17.png)

	*Note: If you don't see any data here, confirm that your dedicated SQL pool is running and that your Power BI workspace is linked to your Synapse workspace.*

4. In the **Power BI Datasets** pane, select **New Power BI Dataset**.

	![](../images/dp500-18.png)

5. In the left pane, at the bottom, select **Start**.

	![](../images/dp500-19.png)

6. Select your SQL pool, **sqldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**, and then select **Continue**.

	![](../images/dp500-20.png)

7. To download the .pbids file, select **Download**.

	![](../images/dp500-21.png)

	*A .pbids file contains a connection to your SQL pool. It's a convenient way to start your project. When opened, it will create a new Power BI Desktop solution that already stores the connection details to your SQL pool.*

8. When the .pbids file has downloaded, open it.

	*When the file opens, it will prompt you to create queries using the connection. You will define those queries in the next task.*

### Create model queries

In this task, you will create five Power Query queries that will each load as a table to your model.

1. In Power BI Desktop, in the **SQL Server Database** window, at the left, select **Microsoft Account**.

	![](../images/dp500-22.png)

2. Select **Sign In**.

3. Sign in using the lab Azure credentials provided.

4. From the drop down please select the option  **workspace<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>.sql.azuresynapse.net;sqldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** as shown below.

   ![](../images1/updated-001.png)
   
4. Select **Connect**.

	![](../images/dp500-23.png)

5. In the **Navigator** window, select (don't check) the **DimDate** table.

6. In the right pane, notice the preview result, which shows a subset of the table rows.

	![](../images/dp500-24.png)

7. To create queries (which will become model tables), check the following seven tables:

	- DimDate

	- DimProduct
  
	- DimProductCategory
  
	- DimProductSubcategory

	- DimReseller

	- DimSalesTerritory

	- FactResellerSales

8. To apply transformations to the queries, at the bottom-right, select **Transform Data**.

	![](../images/dp500-25.png)

	*Transforming the data allows you to define what data will be available in your model.*


9. In the **Connection Settings** window, select the **DirectQuery** option.

	![](../images/dp500-26.png)

	*This decision is important. DirectQuery is a storage mode. A model table that uses DirectQuery storage mode doesn't store data. So, when a Power BI report visual queries a DirectQuery table, Power BI sends a native query to the data source. This storage mode can be used for large data stores like Azure Synapse Analytics (because it could be impractical or uneconomic to import large data volumes) or when near real-time results are required.*

10. Select **OK**.

	![](../images/dp500-27.png)


11. In the **Power Query Editor** window, in the **Queries** pane (located at the left), notice there is one query for each table you checked.

	![](../images/dp500-28.png)

	*You will now revise the definition of each query. Each query will become a model table when it's applied to the model. You will now rename the queries, so they're described in more friendly and concise ways, and apply transformations to deliver the columns required by the known reporting requirements.*

12. Select the **DimDate** query.

	![](../images/dp500-29.png)

13. In the **Query Settings** pane (located at the right), to rename the query, in the **Name** box, replace the text with **Date**, and then press **Enter**.

	![](../images/dp500-30.png)


14. To remove unnecessary columns, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Manage Columns** group, select the **Choose Columns** icon.

	![](../images/dp500-31.png)

15. In the **Choose Columns** window, to uncheck all checkboxes, uncheck the first checkbox.

	![](../images/dp500-32.png)


16. Check the following five columns.

	- DateKey

	- FullDateAlternateKey

	- EnglishMonthName

	- FiscalQuarter

	- FiscalYear

	![](../images/dp500-33.png)

	*This selection of columns determine what will be available in your model.*

17. Select **OK**.

	![](../images/dp500-34.png)

18. In the **Query Settings** pane, in the **Applied Steps** list, notice that a step was added to remove other columns.

	![](../images/dp500-35.png)

	*Power Query defines steps to achieve the desired structure and data. Each transformation is a step in the query logic.*

19. To rename the **FullDateAlternateKey** column, double-click the **FullDateAlternateKey** column header.

20. Replace the text with **Date**, and then press **Enter**.

	![](../images/dp500-36.png)

21. Notice that a new applied step is added to the query.

	![](../images/dp500-37.png)

22. Rename the following columns:

	- **EnglishMonthName** as **Month**

	- **FiscalQuarter** as **Quarter**

	- **FiscalYear** as **Year**

23. To validate the query design, in the status bar (located along the bottom of the window), verify that the query has five columns.

	![](../images/dp500-checkColumns.png)

	*Important: If the query design does not match, review the exercise steps to make any corrections.*

	*The design of the **Date** query is now complete.*

24. In the **Applied Steps** pane, right-click the last step, and then select **View Native Query**.

	![](../images/dp500-38.png)

25. In the **Native Query** window, review the SELECT statement that reflects the query design.

	*This concept is important. A native query is what Power BI uses to query the data source. To ensure best performance, the database developer should ensure this query is optimized by creating appropriate indexes, etc.*

26. To close the **Native Query** window, select **OK**.

	![](../images/dp500-39.png)


27. Select the **DimProductCategory** table. 
    
28. Rename the query to **Product Details**.

29. On the home tab of the ribbon, in the Combine group, select **Merge Queries.** 

	*Note: We are merging queries to get the product details, category and sub category. This will be used in the Product dimension.*

1. Select the **DimProductSubcategory** table from the drop down and select the **ProductCategoryKey** Column in each table. Select **OK**.

	![](../images/dp500-40.png)

	
	*Note: Use the default join for this merge, which is a left outer join.*

2. Expand the **DimProductSubcategory** column. Select the **ProductSubcategoryKey** and the **EnglishProductSubcategoryName** columns. De-select **Use original column name as prefix**.

	![](../images/dp500-41.png)

	*The Expand feature allows joining tables based on foreign key constraints in the source data. The design approach taken by this lab is to join snowflake dimension tables together to produce a denormalized representation of the data.*

1. Select **OK**.
   
2. Remove all columns, except:

   - ProductSubcategoryKey
   
   - EnglishProductCategoryName

   - EnglishProductSubcategoryName

   You should now have three columns with 37 rows.

3.  Select the **DimProduct** query.

	![](../images/dp500-42.png)

28. Rename the query as **Product**.

	![](../images/dp500-43.png)

1. On the home tab of the ribbon, in the Combine group, select **Merge Queries.** 

1. Select the **Product Details** table from the drop down and select the **ProductSubcategoryKey** column in both the Product table and the Product details table.

    ![](../images/dp500-44.png)

1. Select **OK**.

1. Expand the Product Details column and select the **EnglishProductSubcategoryName** and the **EnglishProductCategoryName** columns. 

    ![](../images/dp500-45.png)

	- **EnglishProductSubcategoryName** as **Subcategory**

	- **EnglishProductCategoryName** as **Category**

38. In the **Applied Steps** pane, right-click the last step, and then select **View Native Query**.

	![](../images/dp500-47.png)

39. In the **Native Query** window, review the SELECT statement that reflects the query design.

40. To close the **Native Query** window, select **OK**.

41. Verify that the query has five columns.

	*The design of the **Product** query is now complete.*

42. Select the **DimReseller** query.

	![](../images/dp500-48.png)

43. Rename the query as **Reseller**.

44. Remove all columns, except:

	- ResellerKey

	- BusinessType

	- ResellerName

45. Rename the following columns:

	- **BusinessType** as **Business Type** (separate with a space)

	- **ResellerName** as **Reseller**

46. Verify that the query has three columns.

	*The design of the **Reseller** query is now complete.*

47. Select the **DimSalesTerritory** query.

	![](../images/dp500-49.png)

48. Rename the query as **Territory**.

49. Remove all columns, except:

	- SalesTerritoryKey

	- SalesTerritoryRegion

	- SalesTerritoryCountry

	- SalesTerritoryGroup

50. Rename the following columns:

	- **SalesTerritoryRegion** as **Region**

	- **SalesTerritoryCountry** as **Country**

	- **SalesTerritoryGroup** as **Group**

51. Verify that the query has four columns.

	*The design of the **Territory** query is now complete.*

52. Select the **FactResellerSales** query.

	![](../images/dp500-50.png)

53. Rename the query as **Sales**.

54. Remove all columns, except:

	- ResellerKey

	- ProductKey

	- OrderDateKey

	- SalesTerritoryKey

	- OrderQuantity

	- UnitPrice

	![](../images/dp500-51.png)

55. Rename the following columns:

	- **OrderQuantity** as **Quantity**

	- **UnitPrice** as **Price**

56. To add a calculated column, on the **Add Column** ribbon tab, from inside the **General** group, select **Custom Column**.

	![](../images/dp500-52.png)


57. In the **Custom Column** window, in the **New Column Name** box, replace the text with **Revenue**.

	![](../images/dp500-53.png)

58. In the **Custom Column Formula** box, enter the following formula:

	```
	[Quantity] * [Price]
	```


59. Select **OK**.

60. To modify the column data type, in the **Revenue** column header, select **ABC123**, and then select **Decimal Number**.

	![](../images/dp500-54.png)

61. Review the native query, noticing the **Revenue** column calculation logic.

62. Verify that the query has seven columns.

	*The design of the **Sales** query is now complete.*

1. Right-click on the **Product Details** table and de-select **Enable load**. This will disable the load of the Product Details table to the data model, and it will not appear in the report.

	![](../images/dp500-55.png)

1. Repeat this step, de-selecting Enable load, for the **DimProductSubcategory** table.

63. To apply the queries, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Close** group, select the **Close &amp; Apply** icon.

	![](../images/dp500-56.png)

	*Each query is applied to create a model table. Because the data connection is using DirectQuery storage mode, only the model structure is created. No data is imported. The model now consists of one table for each query.*

64. In Power BI Desktop, when the queries have been applied, at the bottom-left corner in the status bar, notice that the model storage mode is DirectQuery.
