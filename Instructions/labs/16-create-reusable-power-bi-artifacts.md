	>**Note**:Power BI Desktop applies the query to create a model table. It adds a new table that imports population data to the model.*

18. Reposition the **US Population** table near the **Reseller** table.

19. To create a model relationship, from the **US Population** table, drag the **State** column and drop it on the **State-Province** column of the **Reseller** table.

	![](../images/DP500-16-47.png)

20. In the **Create Relationship** window, in the **Cross Filter Direction** dropdown list, select **Both**.

	![](../images1/dp-30.png)

	>**Note**:Each row of the **Reseller** table stores a reseller, so the values found in the **State-Province** column will contain duplicate values (for example, there are many resellers in the state of California). When you create the relationship, Power BI Desktop automatically determines column cardinalities and discovered that it's a many-to-one relationship. To ensure filters propagate from the **Reseller** table to the **US Population** table, the relationship must cross filter in both directions.*

21. Select **OK**.

	![](../images/DP500-16-37.png)

22. To hide the new table, in the header of the **US Population** table, select the visibility icon.

3. In the formula bar, Replace and enter the following measure definition.

	>**Note**: The measure definition is available to copy and paste from the **C:\LabFiles\DP-500-Azure-Data-Analyst\Allfiles\16\Assets\Snippets.txt** file.*

	```
	Sales per Capita =
	DIVIDE(
	SUM(Sales[Sales Amount]),
	SUM('US Population'[Population])
	)
	```

	>**Note**:The measure named **Sales per Capita** uses the DAX [DIVIDE](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/divide-function-dax) function to divide the sum of the **Sales Amount** column by the sum of the **Population** column.*
	
	![](../images1/dp-34.png)


4. On the **Measure Tools** contextual ribbon tab, from inside the **Formatting** group, in the decimal places box, enter **4**.

	![](../images/DP500-16-51.png)

5. To add the measure to the matrix visual, in the **Data** pane, from inside the **Sales** table, drag the **Sales per Capita** field into the table visual.

	>**Note**:The measure evaluates the result by combining data sourced from a remote model in the Power BI service with data from the imported table that is local to your new model.*
	
	![](../images1/dp-35.png)

6. To sort the states by descending sales per capita value, select the **Sales per Capita** column header.
